## Overview
Create a book search app with a simple UI using **Redis, Boostrap and Express-handlebars**


### The challenge

My challenge was to build out this Books Search app using the [Google Book API](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=search+terms) so that user would be able to:
>> Search for any books of their choice, Read or download them

## My process
- I used googleapis for the font by @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Manrope:wght@800&display=swap');
- I Creatively create responsive landing page using boostrap 5, i was greatly inspired by the work of others projects
- I simply fetch google book API data using **Axios**, creat an in-memory key-value pairs to save it on the local browser for faster loading.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Boostrap 5
- express
- Express-handlebars
- Redis
- Google Books API

### What I learned
- Fetching API data and manipulating them
- How to use Redis, it functionalities and methods
- Deep understanding of How Google Books API works
- How to create mobile-first project


### Continued development
- I would like to create modularity in the file structure -  following webpack standard
- I would like to upgrade the books search and reading to individual user account, where they can store, read,shelve books
